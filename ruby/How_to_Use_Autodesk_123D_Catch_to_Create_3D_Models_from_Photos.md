## How to Use Autodesk 123D Catch?
 
To use Autodesk 123D Catch, you will need a device that can run the software and a camera that can take high-quality photos. You can download Autodesk 123D Catch for free from the official website[^1^] or from the app store for iOS or Android devices. Here are the steps to create a 3D model using Autodesk 123D Catch:
 
1. Choose an object or scene that you want to capture. Make sure it has enough details and contrast for the software to recognize. Avoid shiny, transparent, or moving objects.
2. Take multiple photos of your subject from different angles and distances. Try to cover as much of the surface as possible. The more photos you take, the better the result will be. You will need at least 20 photos for a simple object and up to 70 photos for a complex one.
3. Upload your photos to Autodesk 123D Catch using the software or the app. You will need an internet connection for this step. The software will then analyze your photos and create a 3D model based on them.
4. Wait for the software to finish processing your photos. This may take a few minutes or longer depending on the number and quality of your photos.
5. Once your model is ready, you can view it in 3D and rotate, zoom, or pan it. You can also edit your model using tools such as crop, sculpt, smooth, or erase. You can also add textures, colors, or stickers to your model.
6. Save your model to your device or upload it to the Autodesk 123D community gallery. You can also share your model with others via email or social media. You can also export your model to other formats such as STL, OBJ, or PLY for further editing or printing.
